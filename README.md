<h3>ðŸ‘‹ Hello there.</h3>

I'm a full-stack developer.
<br>
Coding for 6 years, doing discord bots and a lot of things. Passionate about anime, that's why my projects have so much weeb energy on them.

Professional in abandoning projects, and loves to mess around with different technologies. Proficient in **JS**, especially on server-side and big fan of [Canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas).

Outside of programming, I love managing and moderating communities and reading some wholesome manga.
